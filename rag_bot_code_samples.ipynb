      "Bot: The goal of the Artemis program is to send humans back to the Moon, and eventually to Mars. The program is designed to build on the success of the Apollo program, which first sent humans to the Moon in the 1960s.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Artemis program has three main goals:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Send humans back to the Moon for the first time since 1972.\n",
      "- Build a permanent Moon base that will serve as a stepping stone to Mars.\n",
      "- Develop new technologies and capabilities that will enable humans to explore more of the solar system.\n",

      "The Artemis program is also designed to be more international than the Apollo program. NASA is working with a number of partner countries, including the United States, Europe, Japan, and Canada, to build and launch the Artemis missions. This collaboration will help to reduce the cost and complexity of the program and will also enable NASA to access new resources and expertise.\n",
